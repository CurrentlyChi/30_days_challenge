#question 1: 
Find the popularity percentage for each user on Meta/Facebook. The popularity percentage is defined as the total number of friends the user has divided by the total number of users on the platform, then converted into a percentage by multiplying by 100.
Output each user along with their popularity percentage. Order records in ascending order by user id.
The 'user1' and 'user2' column are pairs of friends.

My anwser: 
SELECT 
    user1, 
    COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user1) FROM (SELECT user1 FROM facebook_friends UNION SELECT user2 FROM facebook_friends) AS users_union) * 100 AS popularity_percent
FROM (SELECT user1, user2 FROM facebook_friends UNION SELECT user2 AS user1, user1 AS user2 FROM facebook_friends) AS users_union
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1

#question 2:
--Rank guests based on the total number of messages they've exchanged with any of the hosts. Guests with the same number of messages as other guests should have the same rank. Do not skip rankings if the preceding rankings are identical.
Output the rank, guest id, and number of total messages they've sent. Order by the highest number of total messages first.


My anwser: 
select 
    id_guest,
    sum(n_messages),
    dense_rank() over (order by  sum(n_messages) desc)
from 
    airbnb_contacts
group by 
    id_guest
